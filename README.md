# Persistence Optimisation with Spectral Wavelets

This repo contains PyTorch compatible functions to compute lower star filtrations of graphs that can be optimised by minimising an objective function.

Graphs are filtered by the spectral wavelets of the normalised graph Laplacian. 

The mathematical details can be explained in this [this talk](https://youtu.be/jUCNSu8xkSs) 

You can run the jupyter notebook demonstration to see how the ChebyshevWavelets module interface with PyTorch.
